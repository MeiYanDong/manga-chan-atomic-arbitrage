# Operations and cutover runbook

## Pre-deployment gate

1. Check out the exact release commit and run `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` followed by `npm run check`. CI must execute `systemd-analyze verify` on the supplied service units; local macOS checks explicitly report that this Linux-only gate was skipped.
2. Confirm the release source hash matches `deployments/robinhood-mainnet.json`.
3. Provision a strategy-owned managed HTTP endpoint and WSS endpoint. Do not reuse another strategy's configuration file.
4. Configure an independent HTTP reader when available. The two URLs must not alias one another.
5. Create the signer as a host-bound encrypted systemd credential. Stream the key over the encrypted administration channel into `systemd-creds`; never place it in argv, an environment variable or an intermediate plaintext file:

   ```bash
   sudo systemd-creds encrypt --name=manga-private-key - /etc/credstore.encrypted/manga-private-key
   sudo chown root:root /etc/credstore.encrypted/manga-private-key
   sudo chmod 0600 /etc/credstore.encrypted/manga-private-key
   ```

6. Transfer `state.json` and `audit.jsonl` through a private channel. They are runtime evidence, not release assets.
7. Install `deploy/sshd/60-manga-chan-arbitrage-hardening.conf` as an SSH server drop-in, validate with `sshd -t`, reload SSH, and prove a second key-only session before closing the recovery session.

## Single-writer cutover

Before a cloud arm is created:

1. stop and unload the macOS watcher;
2. disarm its authorization;
3. verify that its process and wallet lock are absent;
4. run `npm run reconcile` until the result is `CLEAN`;
5. verify `latest nonce == pending nonce` and compare it with the runtime ledger;
6. run `npm run runtime:verify` on the cloud host;
7. create a new cloud-local arm; never copy an old arm file;
8. start the service and read back systemd state, WSS/HTTP heads, source/runtime hashes, nonce, balance and authorization ID.

If any step is `UNKNOWN`, stop. Local and cloud signers must never overlap.

## UNKNOWN recovery

Run:

```bash
npm run reconcile
```

Possible outcomes:

- `RECONCILE_PENDING` or `RECONCILE_PROVISIONAL_*`: wait and run the same command again;
- `RECONCILED_SUCCESS` / `RECONCILED_REVERTED`: terminal evidence was written;
- `RECONCILE_NOT_OBSERVED`: two readers did not observe the transaction or nonce consumption;
- `RECONCILE_NONCE_CONFLICT` / `RECONCILE_CONFLICT`: keep the lane halted and investigate;
- `RECONCILE_UNKNOWN`: evidence is insufficient.

Only after `NOT_OBSERVED` may an operator explicitly run:

```bash
npm run reconcile -- --rebroadcast-same-raw
```

This sends the previously persisted bytes. It does not replace or reprice the transaction.

## Runtime verification

`npm run runtime:verify` checks:

- managed HTTP and WSS chain IDs and head distance;
- all canonical contract/token/pool targets;
- manifest, local source, runtime ledger and on-chain runtime hash;
- operator, executor balance and wallet latest/pending nonce;
- unresolved mutation state and current arm metadata.

The command is read-only. `RUNTIME_VERIFIED_READY_FOR_ARM` is not a trade or profit receipt.

## Rollback

1. disarm and stop the watcher;
2. reconcile the current wallet lane;
3. repoint `/opt/manga-chan-arbitrage/current` to the prior commit-addressed release;
4. restore the matching runtime schema/config permissions, not just source code;
5. run the prior release's compile and runtime verification;
6. issue a fresh arm only after all evidence is clean.

Never roll code backward while retaining an incompatible runtime ledger or active authorization.

## Alerts

The supplied service exits non-zero on a halted state and invokes an `OnFailure` unit, producing an explicit journal event. A real paging destination is not configured in the public repository; operators must connect that unit to their private notification system and verify delivery before calling alerting complete.

The release installer compiles and verifies the code before atomically moving the `current` symlink. The hardened runtime service only reads that release and writes under `/var/lib/manga-chan-arbitrage`; it does not attempt to compile inside the read-only `/opt` tree at service start.

## Opportunity board deployment

The opportunity board is not part of the signer lane. Provision `/etc/manga-opportunity-board/live.env` from
`deploy/opportunity-board.env.example` with mode `0640 root:manga-board`. Its RPC endpoint must be read-only and distinct
from the watcher's hot HTTP/WSS path. Never copy `MANGA_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`, a key value or the signing strategy's complete
environment into this file.

After installing the release:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now manga-opportunity-board.service
sudo systemctl show manga-opportunity-board.service --property=ActiveState,SubState,MainPID,MemoryCurrent,NRestarts
curl --fail --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:8788/healthz
sudo -u manga-board env MANGA_BOARD_RUN_DIR=/var/lib/manga-opportunity-board npm run board:status
```

The HTTP service deliberately listens only on loopback. View it through an SSH tunnel instead of opening a public
firewall port. The supplied SSH drop-in permits only client-local forwarding to `127.0.0.1:8788`; validate it with
`sshd -t`, reload SSH, and prove a fresh key-only session before relying on the tunnel. Runtime evidence is stored in
`/var/lib/manga-opportunity-board/snapshot.json`, `events.jsonl` and `state.json`; none belongs in Git.

Stopping or rolling back the board must not stop, restart, disarm or change `manga-chan-watcher.service`. Conversely,
board health never proves the signing watcher is armed or trading.
